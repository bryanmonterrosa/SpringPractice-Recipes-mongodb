# SpringPractice-Recipes
Practice Spring Boot project(Unfinished). This is part of an assignment from the Udemy Course: Spring Framework 5: Beginner to Guru and https://github.com/springframeworkguru/spring5-mongo-recipe-app
- Being honest. Most of this repo was a copy paste of https://github.com/springframeworkguru/spring5-mongo-recipe-app (except for Google Cloud and Gitpod integrations), I would not recommend taking the mentioned Udemy course as it was mostly a copy-paste "live" coding section.
